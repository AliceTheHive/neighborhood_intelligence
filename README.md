# skeleton2
This is a base project for front end development using updated techniques from the [original skeleton](https://github.com/navigationarts/skeleton).

## Changes from v1:

- New version moves to Angular and no longer has jQuery by default.
- Build process now done with gulp. Codekit is gone.
- The hope is that an updated project structure that better aligned with application development common/best practices and allow better scaling.
- Updated dev environment setup to follow
